there are a lot of words in here
not all the words reallyt mean anythign im just typing this so you can run my project for fun
do you like words, i really like words. how fast can you run id imagine pretty fast
if you want to test this additintional just start typing words here
you can include lots of newlines and spaces if you want heres an example
















sam cooper was here









newlines

text that is still parsable, check me, check me
run the command with this string: potato
see if it works
i bet itll work
hopefully it works!
if it doesnt work theres prob soemthing going on with the text you provided, or maybe my code
who knows!
this project was just my starter project so I'm not as worried with its functionality but it seems to work when i run it
checkout my next one for something actually cool and interesting and not a worse version of an already existing linux command... cough cough *grep*

anyways thanks
